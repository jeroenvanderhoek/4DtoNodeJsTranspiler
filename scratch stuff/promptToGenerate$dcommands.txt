We are transpiling a 4D project to NodeJS. Here we are transpiling 4D methods to javascript.
4D language is from 4D SAS and it described here on developer.4d.com: https://developer.4d.com/docs/category/4d-language .
Your answer will consist of ONLY javascript which can replace the 4D command which is described here:

You will return ONLY javascript of the following structure:
// If required import node modules with import statements (using latest node version v22)
// Example: import fs from 'fs';

// Transpile the 4Dcommand described above.
// It has a number parameters as describe above. Here 20 parameters have been declared as placeholders, they may not all
// be used by this method.
export default function ($1,$2,$3,$4,$5,$6,$7,$8,$9,$10,$11,$12,$13,$14,$15,$16,$17,$18,$19,$20) {
